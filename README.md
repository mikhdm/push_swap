# push_swap

## Description

This project generates a sequence of predefined commands designed to sort integers distributed across two stacks. It was developed during my studies at 42.

## How to build?

- `make` or `make all` - Compile base part (not including the list manipulation functions).
- `make bonus` - Compile all from previous item + list manipulation functions.
- `make clean` - Remove object and dependencies (-MMD) files.
- `make fclean` - Remove all from the above + main target (.a archive file with all the functions).
- `make re` - run `make fclean` and `make all`.
